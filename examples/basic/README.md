# Basic Example

This example has been validated using [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io/), a Go sdk and test suite for Terraform.
This example deploys a new VPC in your default region, then a subnet within that VPC, a new SSH key to access servers, and a new security group to restrict server access.
